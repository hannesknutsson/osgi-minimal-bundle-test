# osgi-minimal-bundle-test
A test project for trying to create a osgi bundle so that I can learn to use the OSGI framework

This repository was made in order to recieve help on [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56009782/why-am-i-getting-a-bundleexception-when-starting-my-minimal-example-bundle-with).

I have now recieved the help needed from [cschneider](https://github.com/cschneider) who created a pull request on this repository containing the solution to my problem.

I will leave the pull request as it is so that others who will experience the same problem as I can take a look at it and see the solution.
